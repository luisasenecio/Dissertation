This repository will contain all material associated with analysing data for my dissertation

My dissertation topic:
Vast stretches of Scotland are currently being rewilded, some of them by planting trees that hopefully become forests. They are expected to connect ancient woodlands across the country to provide habitats and facilitate dispersion. 
However, it is not clear whether the planted woodlands can become truly equivalent to those that have been only minimally disturbed. 
This is an attempt to answer this question, for which I have collected distribution and abundance data of the vascular ground vegetation layer in three different woodlands. One of them is an ancient Atlantic Rainforest, located on the slopes above Loch Melfort. The second one is called the 'Magazine Wood' because it was used to produce timber for gunpowder and the woodland was home to magazine production factories. In this function, it has been repeatedly harvested and replanted with mostly native tree species, but some exotic broadleaved and coniferous trees have also found their way there. The third woodland is a sparse oak grove, situated just above the Atlantic Rainforest, and consisting mostly of oaks, but also hazel and alder. It was planted to produce charcoal. 
The data I have collected will be combined with a functional trait matrix to inform on the functional diversity of each plot and subsequently between the woodlands.
